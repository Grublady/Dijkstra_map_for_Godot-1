# Dijkstra Algorithm for Godot



### What it does

Howdy !

This is a gdnative project to bring the Dikstra algorithm into godot! It serves as pathfinding in a graph and allow to find all path leading to a point source (or all points accessible from a point target) which is more powerful than the A* algorithm

Note that the API is now stable! Some features might be added

Also note that other uses can be found in this amazing article : http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Dijkstra_Maps_Visualized


### Installing


It doesn't contain the compiled rust library, so it will not work off the bat.

You will have to : 
* install rust compiler and you will most likely have to install the dependencies described in GDNative bindings for rust github.

* Once you do that, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing Cargo.toml and run "cargo build --release" command.

It will compile the rust executable and put it into "res://target/release/" directory (first time around, it may take several minutes, because it has to automatically download and compile all the dependencies). 

If you are on x64 windows, the example should just work from there. Otherwise, you will have to update the "dijkstra_map_library.tres" file. (It tells godot which file to use for the library for each system.)

## Getting Started

After having followed *Installing* direction, open the godot project and open and run one of the demo scenes 
*  /Project Example/dragon_attack.tscn
* /API demo/demo.tscn

toy around with it, the code of dragon_attack is heavily commented
mess with the exports variable in demo.tscn (click on the root node and tweak the values at the topof the inspector)

you can also look at the unit tests in Tests/unit/*

you should also look at our documentation in ./documentation/index.html (open it in your browser)

### Features && HowTo's

# Basic Behaviour
In godot you create a new DijkstraMap Node.
* you start by adding points to it, where point are the only representation of the world for your map:
* then you connect those points between them, you assign a cost to each connections (which represents how hard it is going from one point to another via this connection)

you can do so manually with add_point and connect_points
or automatically with add_*_grid (add_square_grid or add_hexagonal_grid ...)

* once you've done that, you can enable or disable any points  you want from the pathfinding by passing its id to enable_point or disable_point
* you then have to call recalculate with appropriate args, by defaut, if you only pass an id or a PoolIntArray of id's, its gonna calculate the cost from these id's to every other point of your map

* you can then use get_cost_map() to get a dictionary of (the id of a point) -> (the cost to go to that point from the id you specified in recalculate)
* you can use get_direction_map to get a dictionary of (the id of a point) -> (the id of the point where it should go next for moving the fastest to the id you specified in recalculate)
* you can use get_all_points_with_cost_between whose name is self explanatory
# More recalculate flags
* if you look at the documentation you'll see you can optionnaly dive a dictionary to the recalculate method
'max cost' default to INF meaning the map will calculate for all points whose cost are below INF which means.. all points
but sometimes you dont need to recalculate all map, if you have a monster moving on a chess board that has a total of movement points equal to 20, it makes sense to set 'max cost' to 20, meaning we only calculate for the points the monster can actually reach
for more info go look at the documentation
# The usefulness of terrain
* If you look at the documentation you might notice there's a mysterious feature called terrain (you can pass optionnal terrain id for add_point for instance)
this serves the following purpose:
you want to share the same map (without redoing connections each turn) between a warrior that is slow on the forest but quick on the field, and a priest that is quick everywhere (priest are overpowered, you should really fix your game), but the map is very big and you cant afford to recalculate all the map after changing the connections each time
the solution offered by terrain is this: you set the terrain id of forest to, lets say 0 but we'll call it CONST_TERRAIN_FOREST = 0 and CONST_TERRAIN_FIELD = 1
you then set all the terrain id of your points via set_terrain_for_point
and then when you call recalculate, you pass a optional_params = a dictionary where key = "terrain weights" and value = a dictionary of terrains weigth
where key = CONST_TERRAIN_FOREST and the value is a mutiplier of the cost its gonna take for each connection where terrain is the terrain id specified.
for instance value = 1.0 is neutral (and default) but value = 5.0 means its gonna be harder to cross

to be a little more precise I'll give an example: you have four points P(point_id,terrain_id) that are connected like such
P1 <----> P2 <----> P3 <----> P4 
if the terrain of P1 is default (-1 with cost 1.0 by default) and other points are all CONST_TERRAIN_FOREST and the cost between each connection is 1.0
you pass {CONST_TERRAIN_FOREST : 2.0} in optional
going from P1 to P2: cost is connection_cost(=1.0) * (cost_terrainP1(1.0)*cost_terrainP2(2.0)) /2 this connection between to different terrains was mutiplied by 1.5 total is 1.0 * 1.5 = 1.5
going from P2 to P3: cost is connection_cost(=1.0) * (cost_terrainP2(2.0)*cost_terrainP3(2.0)) /2 this connection between to different terrains was mutiplied by 2 total is 1.0 * 2.0 = 2.0

### Notes

Careful ! If you pass arguments of the wrong signature to the rust API, the game will not crash, if you're lucky and have a terminal open, it ight print an error there but not in godot! this issue can be avoided by using a gdscript wrapper
But it can lead to non trivial bugs, consider yourselves warned



A prettier wrapper in GDscript can be found at API demo/IDijkstra.gd
which is nice cause it offers autocompletion but a work in progress only



## Running the tests

If you're familiar with the gut API, you can launch the Gut.tscn and run some test

state of the test : currently few of them pass, its due to the person writing them (me) not having understood the API, but this will be fixed quickly


## Contributing

Open an issue before working on a feature, bugfix, unit tests, then we discuss it, then you can work on it (or let someone else) then do a pull request

Before doing that pull request, If you modified the rust code be sure you have build it "cargo build --release" and it still works! (the unit tests pass, dragon.tscn is running, the demo is running .

## TODO
find a way to compile it to all platforms in order to ship it via the godot asset store
