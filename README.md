# Dijkstra Algorithm for Godot



### What it does



### Installing


It doesn't contain the compiled rust library, so it will not work off the bat.

You will have to : 
* install rust compiler and you will most likely have to install the dependencies described in GDNative bindings for rust github.

* Once you do that, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing Cargo.toml and run "cargo build --release" command.

It will compile the rust executable and put it into "res://target/release/" directory (first time around, it may take several minutes, because it has to automatically download and compile all the dependencies). 

If you are on x64 windows, the example should just work from there. Otherwise, you will have to update the "dijkstra_map_library.tres" file. (It tells godot which file to use for the library for each system.)

## Getting Started

After having followed *Installing* direction, open the godot project and open and run one of the demo scenes 
*  /Project Example/dragon_attack.tscn
* /API demo/demo.tscn

toy around with it, the code of dragon_attack is heavily commented
the code of demo.tscn is still a little immature and shouldnt be taken as example ... (especially the ugly wrapper I put there)

### Notes

Careful ! If you pass arguments of the wrong signature to the rust API, the game will not crash, if you're lucky and have a terminal open, it ight print an error there but not in godot! this issue can be avoided by using a gdscript wrapper
But it can lead to non trivial bugs, consider yourselves warned



A prettier wrapper in GDscript can be found at ???/IDijkstra.gd
which is nice cause it offers autocompletion but a work in progress only



## Running the tests

If you're familiar with the gut API, you can launch the Gut.tscn and run some test
